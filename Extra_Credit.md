# DataViz Extra Credit
Your Name Here  

## Summary

What happens in data visualization class should not stay in data visualization class. If you are interested in earning extra credit (up to 5 points on your project), you can submit a version of your final project to the requisite source. 

### Where to submit

For students who used Kaggle data, you can post your code and results on the Kaggle site. This is common for many Kaggle data sets.

For students who used data from a professor or from another source, you will submit an HTML summary to your professor or to wherever you got the data from. 

For students who are unsure, you can write up your file as a blog post and share it publicly.

### What this entails

Your Extra Credit report should be a mix between the formal final project for our class and what you presented today. My recommendation is to complete the final project as you see fit, and if you are interested in the extra credit, then remove some of the wording and descriptions to make your file more readable. Keep in mind, a professor or the Kaggle site is not going to want to read lengthy words describing each figure, but they are going to want to see *some* substance in terms of writing and motivation.

### Proof

For the credit itself, show me a copy of what was submitted. This could be as simple as cc'ing me on an email, or sending the link to your blog post or Kaggle site.

### Final thought

Know your audience: if you are posting on Kaggle, it is custom to use code. 

If you are presenting to a professor, hide your code.
