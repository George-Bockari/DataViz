#  Homework 01:  Introduction to R, RStudio, Data Types, and Critiquing Graphics

***General instructions for homeworks***: 

+  Make a new R Markdown file (.Rmd), referring to thea assignment on the course Github page
+  Change the heading to include your author name
+  Save the R Markdown file (named as:  [MikeID]-[Homework01].Rmd -- e.g. "mlopez-Lab01.Rmd") to somewhere where you'll be able to access it later (zip drive, My Documents, Dropbox, etc)
+  Your file should contain the code/commands to answer each question in its own code block, which will also produce plots that will be automatically embedded in the output file
+  **Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified) as well as any code used**: In other words, if the answer is `24`, you should write "The answer is 24" (as opposed to just showing the code and output).
+  Include the names of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment


##  Problem 1

**Downloading R and R Studio**:  

If you are using your own, personal computer, you will need to download and install R and RStudio.  Follow the instructions here to do so (be sure to choose the correct operating system, and 64-bit R if possible/compatible):  [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/]

Once you get RStudio open, open the Homework01.Rmd file from Blackboard and open it in RStudio (File / Open...).  It may be helpful to use the Lab01.Rmd file on Blackboard as a template for your submission.  

Click "Knit HTML."

Notice how the text you write in the .Rmd file shows up in the output file each time you click "Knit HTML".  For more tips/tricks on how to format things in R Markdown, go to [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf]

**Where is my output file?**

Find where you stored your [MikeID]-Homework01.Rmd file on your computer.  

In the same directory, there should be a file called [MikeID]-Homework01.html.  

Open it.  It should automatically open in a browser, and it should contain the output.  

In the future, you'll print these .html files and submit as your HW solution. 

**Note**: Be sure to give yourself enough time to print the HTML files on a campus computer. You can store them on zip-drives, but you *cannot* email them to yourself.

**Note**: Knitting as Word documents is not sufficient, as MS Word is not quite compatable with Markdown.


##  Problem 2

**Critiquing Graphs**:

Find a graph from the internet, preferably something that was in a recent (last 7 days) news article, blog post, etc.  Describe and crique your graph, while considering the following questions. 

+  What does the graph show?
+  Does the graph do a good job of achieving its goals?
+  What are the strong points (advantages) of the graphic?
+  What are the weak points (disadvantages) of the graphic?
+  What would you change (if anything) about this graphic?
+  Read the caption and/or surrounding text.  Does the text enhance the user's understanding of the graphic?


## Problem 3

**Introduction to R**:  

Create a single code block that contains R commands to do all of the following:

a.  `(12)*3 - 1`

b.  `sqrt(4)`

c.  `log(100)`. 

d.  Let `y = 2`.  Let `x = 6y + y^2`.  Print `x`.

Is `log()` the base `e` log or base 10 log?


##  Problem 4

Refer to the R Markdown cheatsheet, posted at the beginning of this homework and in the lab. What do the `eval`, `echo`, and `warning` messages do? Try them, to make sure you understand why they might be useful.

##  Problem 5

**Background**


a.  What is your major? 

b.  What experience do you have using R or RStudio?

c.  What skills would you like to get out of this course? 

**When you are done with the assignment, knit as an HTML. Check to make sure your code and output has embedded wherever neccessary (in this assignment, problem 3). When done, print and hand in the HTML file.
