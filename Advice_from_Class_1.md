# DataViz Class Advice
Fall 2016  

## Summary

Students in the Fall 2016 course were asked to give advice to students taking the course in the future. Here is that list, in no particular order

1. Start working on your project as early as possible so you don't have coding issues the night before!

2. Make sure to knit files early and often (sometimes code will run but the file will not knit)

3. You may think you get the hang of different types of graphs, but if you research a bit you can find out what more you can do that was not learned in class.

4. Organize your R files - this will minimize error!

5. Learn to deal with knitting errors *before* you move on 

6. Start homeworks early.

7. Keep your code organized and pay close attention to the order of commands. It is helpful in diagnosing/finding problems when you start writing longer code blocks

8. Google is very useful, and R tends to have good online documentation (ggplot2 specifically)

9. Collect all important code in one place. You will regret having to dig through all of the lectures/labs to find a line of code otherwise. 

10. Stack overflow is your friend

11. Use outside resources (there are many R tutorials online)

12. Think carefully about your graph details, as small code issues can make a big difference

13. It helped to outline our questions and how we were going to visualize the data before making graphs. 

14. Making a graph is not difficult, but it is much more diffiult to interpret the finding and how to improve the graph. Also, it is acceptable to say there is no significant conclusion to make from a graph. 

15. I encourage students to push their limits - make visualizations beyond what was covered in class. See Mike efor help - he is very helpful and I wish I utilized his office hours more.

16. Go see Prof Lopez during office hours or make an appointment! Especially for projects, there are a lot of really great things you can do in RSTudio and ggplot2. Talking to Prof. Lopez outside of class was extremely helpful. Don't limit yourself to code used in Labs/HW - explore on your own as well

17. Knit as you go along to avoid backtracking if something doesn't work, it'll save you at least one headache.

18. Don't give up and/or get too frustrated when R/RStudio doesn't work. Go see Lopez in his office hours because he's helpful and has great taste in music. 

19. The diversity of majors and interests of this class was awesome. Data viz is incredibly interdisciplinary, and I like having comp sci/poly sci/psych/social work majors.
